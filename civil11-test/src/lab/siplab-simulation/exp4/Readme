Steps

1.Load SIVP toolbox. Also keep the folder with the files open in scilab file browser so it takes the image and text files path.

2.Run master.sce (fname can be quickbird.jpg or inputimage, ie the 2 image available in the folder). For inputimage file it takes time to execute approx 2 mins.

3.Values in RGB.txt file can be changed as required. Line is the band values for example 1 1 1 or 1 2 3 or 4 5 6 etc. Next 4 lines are row start,row end, column start and column end values of the subset image. Keeping in mind the size of the image.

4. Values in win4pix.txt can also be changed as required. First line is the position of the 5x5 pixel window values ie 
ULC :upper left corner of image OR
URC :upper right corner of image OR
LLC :lower left corner of image OR
LRC :lower right corner of image OR
Middle :middle of the image OR
User :the position specified by user in the next 4 lines of the file
Last line is the band from which values are taken ie 1 2 or 3.


Outputs
Original image
Subset image
Histogram image (1 image if all bands value in RGB.txt file is same, 3 images if different)
Text file for pixel values in 5x5 window ..name will be ULC1.txt or URC1.txt like this.

Note:
Right now the function bilimage only takes the particular file inputimage and gives output.
